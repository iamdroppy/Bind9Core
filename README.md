# BindNineCore

This is a simple bind9 configuration manager with a simple web interface. I've created according to my needs. It doesn't support all records yet but I don't need other record types for now, as this is part of my home-it project(s). 

### How to configure the file output

In the root, you will find two files, ´zone.liquid´ and ´named.liquid´. Both are the template for outputting to bind9 paths.
